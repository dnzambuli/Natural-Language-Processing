# News Topic Classifier

This is a personal project submitted to fulfill the course requirements for DSA 4020 - Natural Language Processing 

The key concept was `Topic Modeling` selected as the practical part of the course 

## What is Topic Modeling

**Topic modeling** is a machine learning technique used to discover hidden themes or topics within a collection of text documents. It organizes unstructured text data into meaningful clusters of words (topics), helping to summarize and understand the content.

### Concepts in Topic Modeling 

1. **Topic** A group of words or terms that frequently appear together and represent a coherent idea.

- Example: For a dataset of news articles, one topic might include words like government, election, policy, and voting, representing "politics."

2. **Document** A single piece of text, such as an article, email, or paragraph, analyzed in the *corpus*

3. **Corpus** The entire collection of documents used for analysis

4. **Latent Topics** The hidden themes in the text data, inferred by the algorithm

### Popular Methods in Topic Modeling

1. **Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA)**

- The most common topic modeling algorithm.

- Treats each document as a mixture of topics and each topic as a mixture of words.

- Assumes words in a document are generated by sampling from a distribution of topics.

2. **Non-Negative Matrix Factorization (NMF)**

- Uses linear algebra to factorize the document-term matrix into topic and word distributions.

- Works well with sparse and high-dimensional data.

3. **Latent Semantic Analysis (LSA)**

- Uses *singular value decomposition* (SVD) to reduce the dimensionality of the document-term matrix and uncover latent topics.

### Applications of Topic Modeling
1. **Document Clustering** Grouping similar documents based on their topics.
2. **Content Summarization** Highlighting the main themes in large text datasets.
3. **Recommendation Systems** Suggesting articles, books, or products based on identified topics.
4. **Sentiment Analysis** Combining with sentiment scores to identify attitudes within specific topics.

### Example in Practice

> If you analyze a collection of customer reviews, topic modeling can identify themes like:
> 
> "Price" (e.g., expensive, affordable, discount)
> 
> "Customer Service" (e.g., helpful, rude, response time)
> 
>"Product Quality" (e.g., durable, faulty, premium)
>

## Data sources 

**Datasets**
1. [Chichewa dataset](https://zenodo.org/records/4315018)
2. [Amharic and Swahili datasets](https://huggingface.co/datasets/community-datasets/swahili_news/blob/main/README.md)

**Stop Words**
1. [Kiswahili stopwords](https://github.com/stopwords-iso/stopwords-iso)
2. [Chichewa stopwords](https://www.chichewagrammar.net/)
3. [Amharic stopwords](https://www.irit.fr/AmharicResources/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/StopWord-list.txt)

## Model Choice

- NMF 
- LDA

## Model Performance 

|   Language    |       NMF     |      LDA      |
|:--------------|:-------------:|:-------------:|
|   Chichewa    |      23.06    |     18.39     |
|   Amharic     |      22.87    |     13.83     |
|   Swahili     |       8.22    |     11.32     |

## Challenges When Implementing 

|challenge| Solution|
|:----|:----|
|No actual stopword data available for `amharic` and `chichewa`| created the [stopwords]("./data/raw/stopwords.yaml")|
|Encoding for **Amharic text**| using `utf-8` for all reads and data write|
|Data quality in **Amharic**| custom data clean|
