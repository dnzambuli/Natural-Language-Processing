Based on the materials provided, hereâ€™s a sample exam for your Natural Language Processing (NLP) course:

---

### **Exam: Natural Language Processing (NLP)**

#### **Section A: Short Answer Questions (Answer any five)**

1. **Define Natural Language Processing (NLP). What are two primary applications of NLP?**
   
2. **Explain the process and importance of data preprocessing in machine learning.**

3. **Describe the concept of an N-gram in language modeling and give an example of a bigram and trigram.**

4. **What are two advantages and two limitations of using N-gram models in language modeling?**

5. **Differentiate between rule-based and stochastic methods for Part-of-Speech (POS) tagging.**

6. **What is the difference between constituency and dependency parsing? Provide an example of each.**

7. **Describe the purpose of semantic role labeling (SRL) in NLP.**

8. **Explain the significance of Word Sense Disambiguation (WSD) and name two approaches used for WSD.**

---

#### **Section B: Long Answer Questions (Answer any two)**

1. **Explain the role of syntactic parsing in natural language processing. Compare and contrast top-down parsing and bottom-up parsing, including their advantages and disadvantages. Provide examples to illustrate each type.**
   - *(You may reference tools like CKY and Earley algorithms used for syntactic parsing as mentioned in Week 5 notes.)*

2. **Discuss the challenges associated with meaning in NLP. Include an explanation of lexical semantics and compositional semantics, and discuss how tools like WordNet and Word Sense Disambiguation (WSD) contribute to resolving these challenges.**
   - *(Refer to Week 6 materials on semantics for reference on WordNet and semantic analysis techniques.)*
