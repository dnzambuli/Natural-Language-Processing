Something for Spielberg and Lucas to learn from. ;) A sixth-grader Kolya \\\"Nick\\\" Gerasimov finds a time machine in the basement of a decrepit building and travels 100 years into the future. He discovers a near-perfect, utopian society where robots play guitars and write poetry, everyone is kind to each other and people enjoy everything technology has to offer. Alice is the daughter of a prominent scientist who invented a device called Mielophone that allows to read minds of humans and animals. The device can be put to both good and bad use, depending on whose hands it falls into. When two evil space pirates from Saturn who want to rule the universe attempt to steal Mielophone, it falls into the hands of 20th century school boy Nick. With the pirates hot on his tracks, he travels back to his time, followed by the pirates, and Alice. Chaos, confusion and funny situations follow as the luckless pirates try to blend in with the earthlings. Alice enrolls in the same school Nick goes to and demonstrates superhuman abilities in PE class. The catch is, Alice doesn't know what Nick looks like, while the pirates do. Also, the pirates are able to change their appearance and turn literally into anyone. (Hmm, I wonder if this is where James Cameron got the idea for Terminator...) Who gets to Nick -- and Mielophone -- first? Excellent plot, non-stop adventures, and great soundtrack. I wish Hollywood made kid movies like this one...\",\n          \"\\\"National Treasure\\\" (2004) is a thoroughly misguided hodge-podge of plot entanglements that borrow from nearly every cloak and dagger government conspiracy clich\\u00e9 that has ever been written. The film stars Nicholas Cage as Benjamin Franklin Gates (how precious is that, I ask you?); a seemingly normal fellow who, for no other reason than being of a lineage of like-minded misguided fortune hunters, decides to steal a 'national treasure' that has been hidden by the United States founding fathers. After a bit of subtext and background that plays laughably (unintentionally) like Indiana Jones meets The Patriot, the film degenerates into one misguided whimsy after another \\u0096 attempting to create a 'Stanley Goodspeed' regurgitation of Nicholas Cage and launch the whole convoluted mess forward with a series of high octane, but disconnected misadventures.<br /><br />The relevancy and logic to having George Washington and his motley crew of patriots burying a king's ransom someplace on native soil, and then, going through the meticulous plan of leaving clues scattered throughout U.S. currency art work, is something that director Jon Turteltaub never quite gets around to explaining. Couldn't Washington found better usage for such wealth during the start up of the country? Hence, we are left with a mystery built on top of an enigma that is already on shaky ground by the time Ben appoints himself the new custodian of this untold wealth. Ben's intentions are noble \\u0096 if confusing. He's set on protecting the treasure. For who and when?\\u0085your guess is as good as mine.<br /><br />But there are a few problems with Ben's crusade. First up, his friend, Ian Holmes (Sean Bean) decides that he can't wait for Ben to make up his mind about stealing the Declaration of Independence from the National Archives (oh, yeah \\u0096 brilliant idea!). Presumably, the back of that famous document holds the secret answer to the ultimate fortune. So Ian tries to kill Ben. The assassination attempt is, of course, unsuccessful, if overly melodramatic. It also affords Ben the opportunity to pick up, and pick on, the very sultry curator of the archives, Abigail Chase (Diane Kruger). She thinks Ben is clearly a nut \\u0096 at least at the beginning. But true to action/romance form, Abby's resolve melts quicker than you can say, \\\"is that the Hope Diamond?\\\" The film moves into full X-File-ish mode, as the FBI, mistakenly believing that Ben is behind the theft, retaliate in various benign ways that lead to a multi-layering of action sequences reminiscent of Mission Impossible meets The Fugitive. Honestly, don't those guys ever get 'intelligence' information that is correct? In the final analysis, \\\"National Treasure\\\" isn't great film making, so much as it's a patchwork rehash of tired old bits from other movies, woven together from scraps, the likes of which would make IL' Betsy Ross blush.<br /><br />The Buena Vista DVD delivers a far more generous treatment than this film is deserving of. The anamorphic widescreen picture exhibits a very smooth and finely detailed image with very rich colors, natural flesh tones, solid blacks and clean whites. The stylized image is also free of blemishes and digital enhancements. The audio is 5.1 and delivers a nice sonic boom to your side and rear speakers with intensity and realism. Extras include a host of promotional junket material that is rather deep and over the top in its explanation of how and why this film was made. If only, as an audience, we had had more clarification as to why Ben and co. were chasing after an illusive treasure, this might have been one good flick. Extras conclude with the theatrical trailer, audio commentary and deleted scenes.

Something for Spielberg and Lucas to learn from. ;) A sixth-grader Kolya \\\"Nick\\\" Gerasimov finds a time machine in the basement of a decrepit building and travels 100 years into the future. He discovers a near-perfect, utopian society where robots play guitars and write poetry, everyone is kind to each other and people enjoy everything technology has to offer. Alice is the daughter of a prominent scientist who invented a device called Mielophone that allows to read minds of humans and animals. The device can be put to both good and bad use, depending on whose hands it falls into. When two evil space pirates from Saturn who want to rule the universe attempt to steal Mielophone, it falls into the hands of 20th century school boy Nick. With the pirates hot on his tracks, he travels back to his time, followed by the pirates, and Alice. Chaos, confusion and funny situations follow as the luckless pirates try to blend in with the earthlings. Alice enrolls in the same school Nick goes to and demonstrates superhuman abilities in PE class. The catch is, Alice doesn't know what Nick looks like, while the pirates do. Also, the pirates are able to change their appearance and turn literally into anyone. (Hmm, I wonder if this is where James Cameron got the idea for Terminator...) Who gets to Nick -- and Mielophone -- first? Excellent plot, non-stop adventures, and great soundtrack. I wish Hollywood made kid movies like this one...\",\n          \"\\\"National Treasure\\\" (2004) is a thoroughly misguided hodge-podge of plot entanglements that borrow from nearly every cloak and dagger government conspiracy clich\\u00e9 that has ever been written. The film stars Nicholas Cage as Benjamin Franklin Gates (how precious is that, I ask you?); a seemingly normal fellow who, for no other reason than being of a lineage of like-minded misguided fortune hunters, decides to steal a 'national treasure' that has been hidden by the United States founding fathers. After a bit of subtext and background that plays laughably (unintentionally) like Indiana Jones meets The Patriot, the film degenerates into one misguided whimsy after another \\u0096 attempting to create a 'Stanley Goodspeed' regurgitation of Nicholas Cage and launch the whole convoluted mess forward with a series of high octane, but disconnected misadventures.<br /><br />The relevancy and logic to having George Washington and his motley crew of patriots burying a king's ransom someplace on native soil, and then, going through the meticulous plan of leaving clues scattered throughout U.S. currency art work, is something that director Jon Turteltaub never quite gets around to explaining. Couldn't Washington found better usage for such wealth during the start up of the country? Hence, we are left with a mystery built on top of an enigma that is already on shaky ground by the time Ben appoints himself the new custodian of this untold wealth. Ben's intentions are noble \\u0096 if confusing. He's set on protecting the treasure. For who and when?\\u0085your guess is as good as mine.<br /><br />But there are a few problems with Ben's crusade. First up, his friend, Ian Holmes (Sean Bean) decides that he can't wait for Ben to make up his mind about stealing the Declaration of Independence from the National Archives (oh, yeah \\u0096 brilliant idea!). Presumably, the back of that famous document holds the secret answer to the ultimate fortune. So Ian tries to kill Ben. The assassination attempt is, of course, unsuccessful, if overly melodramatic. It also affords Ben the opportunity to pick up, and pick on, the very sultry curator of the archives, Abigail Chase (Diane Kruger). She thinks Ben is clearly a nut \\u0096 at least at the beginning. But true to action/romance form, Abby's resolve melts quicker than you can say, \\\"is that the Hope Diamond?\\\" The film moves into full X-File-ish mode, as the FBI, mistakenly believing that Ben is behind the theft, retaliate in various benign ways that lead to a multi-layering of action sequences reminiscent of Mission Impossible meets The Fugitive. Honestly, don't those guys ever get 'intelligence' information that is correct? In the final analysis, \\\"National Treasure\\\" isn't great film making, so much as it's a patchwork rehash of tired old bits from other movies, woven together from scraps, the likes of which would make IL' Betsy Ross blush.<br /><br />The Buena Vista DVD delivers a far more generous treatment than this film is deserving of. The anamorphic widescreen picture exhibits a very smooth and finely detailed image with very rich colors, natural flesh tones, solid blacks and clean whites. The stylized image is also free of blemishes and digital enhancements. The audio is 5.1 and delivers a nice sonic boom to your side and rear speakers with intensity and realism. Extras include a host of promotional junket material that is rather deep and over the top in its explanation of how and why this film was made. If only, as an audience, we had had more clarification as to why Ben and co. were chasing after an illusive treasure, this might have been one good flick. Extras conclude with the theatrical trailer, audio commentary and deleted scenes.

Something for Spielberg and Lucas to learn from. ;) A sixth-grader Kolya \\\"Nick\\\" Gerasimov finds a time machine in the basement of a decrepit building and travels 100 years into the future. He discovers a near-perfect, utopian society where robots play guitars and write poetry, everyone is kind to each other and people enjoy everything technology has to offer. Alice is the daughter of a prominent scientist who invented a device called Mielophone that allows to read minds of humans and animals. The device can be put to both good and bad use, depending on whose hands it falls into. When two evil space pirates from Saturn who want to rule the universe attempt to steal Mielophone, it falls into the hands of 20th century school boy Nick. With the pirates hot on his tracks, he travels back to his time, followed by the pirates, and Alice. Chaos, confusion and funny situations follow as the luckless pirates try to blend in with the earthlings. Alice enrolls in the same school Nick goes to and demonstrates superhuman abilities in PE class. The catch is, Alice doesn't know what Nick looks like, while the pirates do. Also, the pirates are able to change their appearance and turn literally into anyone. (Hmm, I wonder if this is where James Cameron got the idea for Terminator...) Who gets to Nick -- and Mielophone -- first? Excellent plot, non-stop adventures, and great soundtrack. I wish Hollywood made kid movies like this one...\",\n          \"\\\"National Treasure\\\" (2004) is a thoroughly misguided hodge-podge of plot entanglements that borrow from nearly every cloak and dagger government conspiracy clich\\u00e9 that has ever been written. The film stars Nicholas Cage as Benjamin Franklin Gates (how precious is that, I ask you?); a seemingly normal fellow who, for no other reason than being of a lineage of like-minded misguided fortune hunters, decides to steal a 'national treasure' that has been hidden by the United States founding fathers. After a bit of subtext and background that plays laughably (unintentionally) like Indiana Jones meets The Patriot, the film degenerates into one misguided whimsy after another \\u0096 attempting to create a 'Stanley Goodspeed' regurgitation of Nicholas Cage and launch the whole convoluted mess forward with a series of high octane, but disconnected misadventures.<br /><br />The relevancy and logic to having George Washington and his motley crew of patriots burying a king's ransom someplace on native soil, and then, going through the meticulous plan of leaving clues scattered throughout U.S. currency art work, is something that director Jon Turteltaub never quite gets around to explaining. Couldn't Washington found better usage for such wealth during the start up of the country? Hence, we are left with a mystery built on top of an enigma that is already on shaky ground by the time Ben appoints himself the new custodian of this untold wealth. Ben's intentions are noble \\u0096 if confusing. He's set on protecting the treasure. For who and when?\\u0085your guess is as good as mine.<br /><br />But there are a few problems with Ben's crusade. First up, his friend, Ian Holmes (Sean Bean) decides that he can't wait for Ben to make up his mind about stealing the Declaration of Independence from the National Archives (oh, yeah \\u0096 brilliant idea!). Presumably, the back of that famous document holds the secret answer to the ultimate fortune. So Ian tries to kill Ben. The assassination attempt is, of course, unsuccessful, if overly melodramatic. It also affords Ben the opportunity to pick up, and pick on, the very sultry curator of the archives, Abigail Chase (Diane Kruger). She thinks Ben is clearly a nut \\u0096 at least at the beginning. But true to action/romance form, Abby's resolve melts quicker than you can say, \\\"is that the Hope Diamond?\\\" The film moves into full X-File-ish mode, as the FBI, mistakenly believing that Ben is behind the theft, retaliate in various benign ways that lead to a multi-layering of action sequences reminiscent of Mission Impossible meets The Fugitive. Honestly, don't those guys ever get 'intelligence' information that is correct? In the final analysis, \\\"National Treasure\\\" isn't great film making, so much as it's a patchwork rehash of tired old bits from other movies, woven together from scraps, the likes of which would make IL' Betsy Ross blush.<br /><br />The Buena Vista DVD delivers a far more generous treatment than this film is deserving of. The anamorphic widescreen picture exhibits a very smooth and finely detailed image with very rich colors, natural flesh tones, solid blacks and clean whites. The stylized image is also free of blemishes and digital enhancements. The audio is 5.1 and delivers a nice sonic boom to your side and rear speakers with intensity and realism. Extras include a host of promotional junket material that is rather deep and over the top in its explanation of how and why this film was made.

sure, these families have been through a lot. sure, they deserve nicer things that what they had previously had. but honestly, the things that ty pennington and his crew put into these houses are enough to suit an entire neighborhood. another thing that really irks me about this show is how ty and his crew always have something good to say about every little thing that relates to the family, or the family's condition. telling a wheelchair-bound person that he or she is 'so strong', or 'very brave' really does get old after a while. that may sound rude, but believe me; watch this show, and you'll see what i mean. all in all, this show is overrated. if you want to watch it, go ahead. this comment is just a heads-up for what you'd be watching.\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    }\n  ]\n}"}},"metadata":{},"execution_count":9}],"source":["from sklearn.preprocessing import LabelEncoder\n","\n","label_encoder_x = LabelEncoder()\n","dataset.iloc[:, 1]= label_encoder_x.fit_transform(dataset.iloc[:, 1])\n","dataset.head(n = 5)"]},{"cell_type":"markdown","id":"a3c04995-abd8-40f0-bcd1-3a71c556ee41","metadata":{"id":"a3c04995-abd8-40f0-bcd1-3a71c556ee41"},"source":["The data has been encoded such that\n","\n","| Value| Representation|\n","|:-----|-----:|\n","|Positive| 1|\n","|Negative| 0|\n","\n","\n","Now\n","\n","# Perform Splitting of Data into Training and Test Set"]},{"cell_type":"code","source":["dataset.to_csv(\"/content/drive/MyDrive/NLP Quiz 1/Clean_IMDB_Dataset.csv\")"],"metadata":{"id":"lMmooUG_zlNs","executionInfo":{"status":"ok","timestamp":1727206953153,"user_tz":-180,"elapsed":4021,"user":{"displayName":"Daniel Nzambuli","userId":"18246030830990136580"}}},"id":"lMmooUG_zlNs","execution_count":10,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"code","execution_count":11,"id":"22a77b79-b919-4b53-ba88-130968cfbb25","metadata":{"id":"22a77b79-b919-4b53-ba88-130968cfbb25","outputId":"aed83419-2bf3-43c0-942e-1806d96bdcaa","colab":{"base_uri":"https://localhost:8080/"},"executionInfo":{"status":"ok","timestamp":1727206953155,"user_tz":-180,"elapsed":38,"user":{"displayName":"Daniel Nzambuli","userId":"18246030830990136580"}}},"outputs":[{"output_type":"execute_result","data":{"text/plain":["Index(['review', 'sentiment', 'clean_review'], dtype='object')"]},"metadata":{},"execution_count":11}],"source":["dataset.columns"]},{"cell_type":"code","execution_count":12,"id":"b7b793af-c901-4314-b3c4-6bff06a9560c","metadata":{"id":"b7b793af-c901-4314-b3c4-6bff06a9560c","executionInfo":{"status":"ok","timestamp":1727206953895,"user_tz":-180,"elapsed":772,"user":{"displayName":"Daniel Nzambuli","userId":"18246030830990136580"}}},"outputs":[],"source":["from sklearn.model_selection import train_test_split\n","\n","x = np.array(dataset.iloc[:,2])\n","y = np.array(dataset.iloc[:,1])\n","\n","x_train, x_test, y_train, y_test = train_test_split(x, y, test_size = 0.2, random_state = 21)"]},{"cell_type":"markdown","id":"aa7f85e3-f9e3-40b2-9bcc-c0b128df3336","metadata":{"id":"aa7f85e3-f9e3-40b2-9bcc-c0b128df3336"},"source":["## Parameters of train_test_split\n","\n","1. **x** -- the independent variable\n","2. **y** -- the dependent variable\n","3. **test_size** -- the proportion of the whole dataset that will be part of the training dataset\n","4. **random_state** -- the seed for random selection\n","\n","there is no need to perform `Feature engineering`.

i've enjoyed the jon cleary books about scobie malone, but there's little resemblance between him and the cinematic malone. in the books he's a city detective, who is devoted to his wife and doesn't get involved in fisticuffs. for the film the character has been spiced up, into an outback copper who uses his fists and isn't averse to jumping into bed with a gorgeous girl, though quite what she and the film's other sex interest see in him i don't know; taylor was 39 at the time and his face was getting puffy. but his character's stamina is remarkable; he flies in from australia, apparently goes straight to the commissioner's house (rather unwisely seeking to arrest him during a black-tie reception), saves him from assassination (getting into a fight in the process), goes to a casino with one girl, leaves with another and takes her to bed. so much for jet lag! on the way back to the commissioner's house (showing a good knowledge of london back streets), he gets beaten up by the baddies, but is still first down to breakfast! it's also remarkable that the commissioner's limo has its windscreen and headlights miraculously repaired within minutes of the assassination attempt and that one character has a touching faith in the precise timekeeping of a clock-activated bomb. the best thing is joseph the butler's disdain for the uncouth malone. and at least the film avoids being a london travelogue, though some scenes take place during the wimbledon tennis week.\",\n          \"i just can't agree with the above comment - there's lots of interesting and indeed amazing filmic imagery in this one, it has an unusual structure and moves well toward a frightening climactic sequence that is notable for it's effective use of silence. what's more, it explores the odd impulse of suicide in a very frank way, not pulling any punches in what it shows, yet not dwelling and over-sensationalising the subject matter. it has hints of documentary about it as well as horror and art-house cinema, and deserves a place amongst the canon of 'different' horror films like the blair witch project and the original ring (both of which it predates and could well be an unacknowledged influence on). it's definitely worth seeing if you're interested in the edges of horror cinema.\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"sentiment\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"date\",\n        \"min\": 0,\n        \"max\": 1,\n        \"num_unique_values\": 2,\n        \"samples\": [\n          0,\n          1\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"tokens\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"object\",\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    }\n  ]\n}"}},"metadata":{},"execution_count":15}],"source":["clean_df = pd.DataFrame({\n","    'review':x_train,\n","    'sentiment': y_train})\n","clean_df['tokens'] = clean_df['review'].apply(preproc_text)\n","clean_df.head(n = 5)"]},{"cell_type":"code","source":["clean_df.to_csv(\"/content/drive/MyDrive/NLP Quiz 1/token_data.csv\")"],"metadata":{"id":"jP0-fh4x2y5t","executionInfo":{"status":"ok","timestamp":1727207003070,"user_tz":-180,"elapsed":6750,"user":{"displayName":"Daniel Nzambuli","userId":"18246030830990136580"}}},"id":"jP0-fh4x2y5t","execution_count":16,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"markdown","id":"0a21bc15-886b-4313-8da9-41da5806fb19","metadata":{"id":"0a21bc15-886b-4313-8da9-41da5806fb19"},"source":["# Create N-grams"]},{"cell_type":"code","execution_count":17,"id":"d3048128-857b-4c3a-8724-5d2171434078","metadata":{"id":"d3048128-857b-4c3a-8724-5d2171434078","executionInfo":{"status":"ok","timestamp":1727207003072,"user_tz":-180,"elapsed":22,"user":{"displayName":"Daniel Nzambuli","userId":"18246030830990136580"}}},"outputs":[],"source":["def gen_ngram(token, no_n_gram):\n","    ngrams = zip(*[token[i:] for i in range(no_n_gram)])\n","    return [' '.join(ngram) for ngram in ngrams]\n","\n","# store n-grams\n","ngram_counts = defaultdict(lambda: defaultdict(int))"]},{"cell_type":"code","execution_count":18,"id":"80f81b6e-e941-47a7-b6db-a6e74f474082","metadata":{"id":"80f81b6e-e941-47a7-b6db-a6e74f474082","executionInfo":{"status":"ok","timestamp":1727207036537,"user_tz":-180,"elapsed":33486,"user":{"displayName":"Daniel Nzambuli","userId":"18246030830990136580"}}},"outputs":[],"source":["for tokens in clean_df['tokens']:\n","    for n in range(1, 4):  # Generate 1, 2, 3\n","        ngrams = gen_ngram(tokens, n)\n","        for ngram in ngrams:\n","            ngram_counts[n][ngram] += 1"]},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":["## Unigram\n","\n","**example** The cloud is dark grey.
